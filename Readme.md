# LeetCode Guardian Goal: Progress and Plan

My current goal is to achieve the **LeetCode Guardian** role by improving my problem-solving speed and accuracy. Iâ€™ll be documenting my progress as I work towards this target.

## Simple Plan:
1. **Virtual Contests**: Participate in virtual contests regularly (no live contests until I can consistently solve three problems per contest).
2. **Post-Contest Review**: After each contest, solve one additional problem from the contest the next day, focusing on learning the underlying concepts.

I will track my daily improvements and progress here as I work towards this goal.
